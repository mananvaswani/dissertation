@article{knill2001,
	Abstract = {Quantum computers promise to increase greatly the efficiency of solving problems such as factoring large integers, combinatorial optimization and quantum physics simulation. One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

@article{monz2016,
	Abstract = {A quantum computer is expected to outperform its classical counterpart in certain tasks. One such task is the factorization of large integers, the technology that underpins the security of bank cards and online privacy. Using a small-scale quantum computer comprising five trapped calcium ions, Monz et al. implement a scalable version of Shor{\textquoteright}s factorization algorithm. With the function of ions being recycled and the architecture scalable, the process is more efficient than previous implementations. The approach thus provides the potential for designing a powerful quantum computer, but with fewer resources.Science, this issue p. 1068Certain algorithms for quantum computers are able to outperform their classical counterparts. In 1994, Peter Shor came up with a quantum algorithm that calculates the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than a classical computer. For general scalability of such algorithms, hardware, quantum error correction, and the algorithmic realization itself need to be extensible. Here we present the realization of a scalable Shor algorithm, as proposed by Kitaev. We factor the number 15 by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four {\textquotedblleft}cache qubits{\textquotedblright} and by implementing generalized arithmetic operations, known as modular multipliers. This algorithm has been realized scalably within an ion-trap quantum computer and returns the correct factors with a confidence level exceeding 99\%.},

The expression thus found forS has a very high degree of symmetry (a fact which the Feynman graph technique could not reveal; our procedure is also free from several shortcomings of this technique), which suggests the existence in the theory of deeper properties.

@article{wu2018,
	Abstract = {{Boson sampling, thought to be intractable classically, can be solved by a quantum machine composed of merely generation, linear evolution and detection of single photons. Such an analog quantum computer for this specific problem provides a shortcut to boost the absolute computing power of quantum computers to beat classical ones. However, the capacity bound of classical computers for simulating boson sampling has not yet been identified. Here we simulate boson sampling on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which occupied the first place in the world ranking six times from 2013 to 2016. We computed the permanent of the largest matrix using up to 312 000 CPU cores of Tianhe-2, and inferred from the current most efficient permanent-computing algorithms that an upper bound on the performance of Tianhe-2 is one 50-photon sample per ∼100 min. In addition, we found a precision issue with one of two permanent-computing algorithms.}},
